# Unit-Test-in-Python
Unit Testcase Scenarios using Python for Boolean Problem 
Write a Python function which takes a list of integers and returns True if the list satisfies the criteria above, or False otherwise. 
For example with the list [4, 5, 15, 2, 8], there is no pair of integers where their sum is in the list. 
The list [4, 5, 3,2, 8] does not satisfy the criteria since the sum of 5 and 3 is in the list.

O/P

when output is OK and Test case Ran were present in the console then the TestCases passed and evaluate if not based on error we need to carry out
